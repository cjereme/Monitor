## v.1
This is my first commit for the Monitors proj.
This uses postgreSQL, nodejs, ejs views. 

Steps to use:
Install Postgres DB - there are several tutorials online for your system
Install nodejs, npm install express and pg modules

Review the server.js code when you configure your postgres DB

There is also a users.txt file that is an sql dump of test data on Parents and Monitors tables. Look for the 'John Doe' and 'Adam Smith' data to insert as samples.
